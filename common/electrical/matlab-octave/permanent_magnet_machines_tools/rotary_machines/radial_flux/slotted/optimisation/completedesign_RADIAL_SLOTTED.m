% Syntax

% design = completedesign_RADIAL_SLOTTED(design, simoptions, setchoice)
%
% Description
%
% completedesign_RADIAL_SLOTTED takes a minimal design structure describing
% a slotted radial flux permanent magnet machine design and completes it by
% calculating various dimensions and parameters and properties of the
% machine windings etc. The design dimensions can be specified either as
% dimensionless ratios or actual dimensions. All variables are supplied as
% fields in a machine design structure.
%
% The design can be for either an internal or external armature. This is
% specified in the field 'ArmatureType' which must contain a string, either
% 'internal' or 'external'. Any unambiguous substring is also acceptable,
% e.g 'e' or'i', or 'ext', or 'in'.
% 
% In general, all dimensions which refer to a radial measurement from the
% center of the machine are prefixed with the capital letter 'R'.
%
% For an INTERNAL ARMATURE machine, the design structure must also contain
% either all the fields:

%
% This completes the specification of the physical dimentions of the
% armature and field.
%
% In addition, a winding specification must be supplied. The winding is
% described using the following variables:
%
%  yp - Average coil pitch as defined by (Qs/Poles)
%  yd - Actual coil pitch as defined by round(yp) +/- k
%  Qs  -  total number of stator slots in machine
%  Qc  -  total number of winding coils in machine 
%  q  -  number of slots per pole and phase
%  qn  -  numerator of q
%  qd  -  denominator of q
%  qc - number of coils per pole and phase
%  qcn  -  numerator of qc
%  qcd  -  denominator of qc
%  Qcb - basic winding (the minimum number of coils required to make up a 
%    repetitive segment of the machine that can be modelled using symmetry)
%  pb - the number of poles corresponding to the basic winding in Qcb
%
% This pole/slot/coil/winding terminology is based on that presented in
% [1].
%
% Machine windings can be single or double layered, in which case:
%
% Single layer
%   q = 2qc
%   Qs = 2Qc
% Double layer
%   q = qc
%   Qs = Qc
%
% To specify a winding, the 'minimum spec' that must be provided is based on
% a combination of some or all of the following variables:
%
%  Phases - The number of phases in the machine
%  Poles - The number of magnetic poles in the machine
%  NBasicWindings - the number of basic winding segments in the machine
%  qc - number of coils per pole and phase (as a fraction object)
%  Qc - total number of coils (in all phases) in the machine
%
% Any of the following combinations may be supplied to specify the winding:
%
%   Poles, Phases, Qc
%   Poles, Phases, qc
%   qc, Phases, NBasicWindings
%
% These variables must be provided as fields in the design structure. If
% 'qc' is supplied, it must be an object of the class 'fr'. This is a class
% designed for handling fractions. See the help for the ''fr'' class for
% further information.
