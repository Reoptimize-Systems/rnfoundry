function [g, actForce] = airgapclosure_PMSM(design, E, IVars, IMethod, sections, mode, forceRatio, initDef, alphab)
% airgapclosure_PMSM: a function for calculaing the variation in the
% air-gap due to the deflection of the supporting structure undergoing
% stresses due to the magnetic fields in the machine
%
% Input:
%
%   design - Standard PMSM design structure
%
%   E - (1 x 2) Vector containing Young's modulus of the beam materials.
%       The first value is Young Modulus of the I-beam support on the
%       stator(s) the second is for the translator.
%
%   IVars - (1 x 2) cell array of values, each of which contains a matrix
%           of values for calculating the second moment of area of the
%           stator and translator sections repectively, the the values in
%           the second cell are used for both stator sections if a double
%           sided machine is being investigated.
%
%           The contents of the first cell of IVars is determined by the
%           type of beam to be used to support the structure, as specified
%           in the IMethod field (below). 
%
%           If an I-Beam is to be used it will contain the following values
%
%           IVars{1}(1,1): b, width of the I-beam flanges
%           IVars{1}(1,2): t, the thickness of the flanges
%           IVars{1}(1,3): tw, the thickness of the I-Beam vertical part
%           IVars{1}(1,4): d, height of the I-Beam vertical part
%
%           If an alternative section is to be used, it will contain
%           appropriate values for that beam.
%
%           The second cell of IVars
%
%           IVars{2}(1,1): dbi, half thickness of central section (back 
%                          iron thickness)
%           IVars{2}(1,2): Wp, the pole width
%           IVars{2}(1,3): hs, the tooth height
%           IVars{2}(1,4): bt, the tooth width
%
%   IMethod - Defines the type of beam section used when calculating the
%             area moment of inertia. See 'MomentOfInertiaY1' for details.
%
%   sections - the number of sections into which the beam supporting the
%              magnets on the field is to be split into for the purposes of
%              calculating the variation in force with deflection
%
%   mode - a scalar value, if 0, values are calculated for a single-sided
%          machine, if 1, a double sided machine is analysed.
%
%   initDef - either (n x 1) vector or (n x sections) matrix. This contains
%             values of initial deflections in the machine parts. I.e. if
%             single sided, this is either a (2 x 1) vector or (2 x
%             sections) matrix. If vector, each value is a uniform
%             deflection along the span of the corresponding part. If
%             matrix, this is the initial deflection in each section as
%             defined by 'sections'. In either machine the deflections are
%             positive upwards and negative downwards. Conceptually the
%             machine is thought of lying on one side. 
%
%             If we consider a single-sided machne, the armature would lie
%             below the field such that if the two are being squeezed
%             toward one-another the deflection in the field is negative,
%             and the deflection in the armature is positive. The initial
%             deflections in the field are in the first row of initDef, and
%             the initial deflections in the armature in the second row.
%
%             If we consider a double-sided machne, the initial delfections
%             in the top field are in row 1, the deflections in the
%             armature are in row 2, and the deflections in the bottom
%             armature are in row 3.
%             
%   alphab - optional scalar factor for increasing the length of the beam
%            in order to incorporate the bearings. Varies from 1 upwards
%            where 1 is a beam fixed at the point where the bearings begin.
%            Is set to one if omitted
%
% Output:
%
%   g - (n x sections) matrix of new values for the air gap in the machine.
%       There will be one value of g for each of the sections being
%       considered. if a single-sided machine is being examined this will
%       be a vector, if a double sided machine, this will be a matrix with
%       two rows, one for each side of the machine.
