% Syntax
%
% design = odeelectricalresults(T, Iphase, EMF, RPhase, design, simoptions)
%
% Description
%
% calculates the electrical outputs, and exported power from an ode
% simulation of a generator. The results are added as fields to the input
% design structure.
%
% Input
%
%  T - (n x 1) vector of time points at which the simulation was evaluated
%
%  Iphase - (n x p) Time series of values of the phase currents produced by
%   the generator, each column is a generator phase.
%
%  EMF - (n x p) Time series of values of the phase emfs produced by the
%   generator, each column is a generator phase.
%
%  RPhase - either (1 x p) or (n x p) matrix. Each row in RPhase is the
%   phase resistances of the machine at each time step. May be a (1 x p)
%   vector if RPhase is not varying with time.
