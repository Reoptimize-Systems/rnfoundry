function d = skindepth(rho, mu_r, freq)
% calculates the skin depth at a given frequency of oscillating magnetic
% field in a good conductor
%
% Syntax
%
% d = skindepth(rho, mu_r, freq)
%
% Input
%
% rho - the resistivity of the material 
%
% mu_r - relative permeability of the material
%
% freq - frequency of field oscillation in Hz
%
% Output
%
% d - the effective depth of penetration of the the field (the depth where
%   its value has fallen to around 1/e of that on the surface)
%

      % formula is:
      %
      % sqrt(2 .* rho ./ (mu_r .* mu_0 .* 2 .* pi .* freq));
      % 
      % To reduce operations (why? it might be called many times):
      %
      % 2 cancels top and bottom
      %
      % mu_0 * pi = 4e-7 * pi * pi = 3.947841760435743e-06
      %
      d = sqrt (rho ./ (mu_r .* 3.947841760435743e-06 .* freq));
